<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is sorrow in Beechenbrook Cottage; the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been bright with the earliest glory of May;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue of the sky is as tender a blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever the sunshine came shimmering through:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The songs of the birds and the hum of the bees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they merrily dart in and out of the trees,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blooms of the orchard, as sifting its snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It mingles its odors with hawthorn and rose,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of the brook, as it lapses unseen,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laughter of children at play on the green,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insist on a picture so cheerful, so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ever would dream that a grief could be there!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The last yellow sunbeam slides down from the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purple of evening is ready to fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gladness of daylight is gone, and the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of something like sadness is over the room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right bravely all day, with a smile on her brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has Alice been true to her duty,&mdash;but now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tasks are all ended,&mdash;naught inside or out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the thoughtfullest love to be busy about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knapsack well furnished, the canteen all bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soldier's grey dress and his gauntlets in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blanket tight strapped, and the haversack stored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lying beside them, the cap and the sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No last, little office,&mdash;no further commands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No service to steady the tremulous hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wife-work,&mdash;the sweet work that busied her so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is finished:&mdash;the dear one is ready to go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a sob has escaped her all day,&mdash;not a moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the tide rushes,&mdash;for she is alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fresh, shining knapsack she pillows her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeps as a mourner might weep for the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heeds not the three-year old baby at play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As donning the cap, on the carpet he lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she feels on her forehead, his fingers' soft tips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her shut eyelids, the touch of his lips.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mamma is <i>so</i> sorry!&mdash;Mamma is <i>so</i> sad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Archie can make her look up and be glad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've been praying to God, as you told me to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Papa may come back when the battle is thro':&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says when we pray, that our prayers shall be heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mamma, don't you <i>always</i> know, God keeps his word?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Around the young comforter stealthily press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms of his father with sudden caress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fast to his heart,&mdash;love and duty at strife,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snatches with fondest emotion, his wife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My own love! my precious!&mdash;I feel I am strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know I am brave in opposing the wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could stand where the battle was fiercest, nor feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One quiver of nerve at the flash of the steel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could gaze on the enemy guiltless of fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I quail at the sight of your passionate tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My calmness forsakes me,&mdash;my thoughts are a-whirl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stout-hearted man is as weak as a girl.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've been proud of your fortitude; never a trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of yielding, all day, could I read in your face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a look that was resolute, dauntless and high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever flashed forth from a patriot's eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know how you cling to me,&mdash;know that to part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is tearing the tenderest cords of your heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the length and the breadth of our Valley to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hand will a costlier sacrifice lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the altar of Country; and Alice,&mdash;sweet wife!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never have worshipped you so in my life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor heart,&mdash;that has held up so brave in the past,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor heart! must it break with its burden at last?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The arms thrown about him, but tighten their hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheek that he kisses, is ashy and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed with the grief she so long has suppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She weeps herself quiet and calm on his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, in a voice just as steady and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it had never been choked by a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raises her eyes with a softened control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through them her husband looks into her soul.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I feel that we each for the other could die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your heart to my own makes the instant reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dear as you are, Love,&mdash;my life and my light,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not consent to your stay, if I might:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No!&mdash;arm for the conflict, and on, with the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virginia has need of her bravest and best!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart&mdash;it must bleed, and my cheek will be wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never, believe me, with selfish regret:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ardor abates not one jot of its glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the tears of the wife and the woman <i>will</i> flow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our cause is so holy, so just, and so true,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God! I can give a defender like you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For home, and for children,&mdash;for freedoms&mdash;for bread,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the house of our God,&mdash;for the graves of our dead,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For leave to exist on the soil of our birth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For everything manhood holds dearest on earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>these</i> are the things that we fight for&mdash;dare I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold back my best treasure, with plaint or with sigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cheek would blush crimson,&mdash;my spirit be galled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If <i>he</i> were not there when the muster was called!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we pleaded for peace, every right was denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every pressing petition turned proudly aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now God judge betwixt us!&mdash;God prosper the right!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To brave men there's nothing remains, but to fight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grudge you not, Douglass,&mdash;die, rather than yield,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the old heroes,&mdash;come home on your shield!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The morning is breaking:&mdash;the flush of the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is warning the soldier, 'tis time to be gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children around him expectantly wait,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horse, all caparisoned, paws at the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With face strangely pallid,&mdash;no sobbings,&mdash;no sighs,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only a luminous mist in her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife is subduing the heart-throbs that swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calming herself for a quiet farewell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There falls a felt silence:&mdash;the note of a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tremulous twitter,&mdash;is all that is heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The circle has knelt by the holly-bush there,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listen,&mdash;there comes the low breathing of prayer.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The feathery foliage has broadened its leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And June, with its beautiful mornings and eves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its magical atmosphere, breezes and blooms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its woods all delicious with thousand perfumes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First-born of the Summer,&mdash;spoiled pet of the year,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">June, delicate queen of the seasons, is here!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sadness has passed from the dwelling away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quiet serenity brightens the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With innocent prattle, her toils to beguile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of her children, the mother <i>must</i> smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With matronly cares,&mdash;those relentless demands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the strength of her heart and the skill of her hands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hours come tenderly, ceaselessly fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave her small space for the broodings of thought.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thank God!&mdash;busy fingers a solace can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lighten the burden of body or mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Eden's old curse proves a blessing instead,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou toil for thy bread."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the bless'd relief in all labours that lurk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, thank Him, unhappy ones,&mdash;thank Him for work!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus Alice engages her thoughts and her powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And industry kindly lends wings to the hours:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor, petty employments they sometimes appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her bright needle there plashes a tear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half shame and half passion;&mdash;what would she not dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fervid compatriots' struggles to share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It irks her,&mdash;the weakness of womanhood then,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet such are the tears that make heroes of men!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She feels the hot blood of the nation beat high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapture she catches the rallying cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mountain and valley and hamlet they come!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side echoes the roll of the drum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A people as firm, as united, as bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever drew blade for the blessings they hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Step sternly and solemnly forth in their might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swear on their altars to die for the right!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The clatter of spurs on the stout-booted heel,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waving of banners,&mdash;the resonant tramp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of marching battalions,&mdash;the fiery stamp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of steeds in their war-harness, newly decked out,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blast of the bugle,&mdash;the hurry, the shout,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrible energy, eager and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lights up the face of man, woman and child,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burns on all lips, that arouses all powers;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their dormant capacities fired,&mdash;to seize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every feminine weapon their skill can command,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To labor with head, and with heart, and with hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stitch the rough jacket, they shape the coarse shirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheeding though delicate fingers be hurt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bind the strong haversack, knit the grey glove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor falter nor pause in their service of love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When ever were people subdued, overthrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With women to cheer them on, brave as our own?<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
